        <div> I am here to support you with algebra, statistics, and any math-related questions you have. I am passionate about helping students overcome math anxiety by encouraging a shift from a fixed mindset ("I'm not good at math") to a growth mindset ("I can learn and improve in math"). With my experience in linear algebra, calculus, and a variety of other math topics, I can help you tackle homework, clarify concepts, and prepare for exams. Additionally, I can also assist with SI-425 and SI-370. My goal is to make math more accessible and enjoyable, and I’m excited to help you succeed and reach your academic goals. </div>

        <div>Hi! My name is Emily and I am a first-year MADS student enjoying all of the opportunities our program has to offer. I got started with MADS shortly after graduating from Purdue University in Indianapolis with a degree in pure mathematics. I love to talk math and have expertise in subjects ranging from statistics and linear algebra to calculus and abstract number theory. Outside of that, I enjoy running, trying out new recipes, and spending time outdoors. I am so excited to get to know you and support you with anything math-related!</div>
